# GameFi Satellite Contract

A CosmWasm-based smart contract for GameFi applications, designed to support local game logic and cross-chain (IBC) interactions. This contract includes CW721 features, extended storage, and an IBC module for interoperability between Cosmos-based chains.

Built for every IBC-powered dAPPS that want to implement custom logic on NFTs without make them leave the home-chain.
